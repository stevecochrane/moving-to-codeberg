# moving-to-codeberg

I've decided to boycott Microsoft (along with several other major tech companies) and I'm in the process of moving all of my code to Codeberg. tailwindcss-logical is an exception and will probably stay here a while longer because others are actively contributing to it.

I'll write more on this eventually, but for now, here is where my code will live going forward: https://codeberg.org/stevecochrane
